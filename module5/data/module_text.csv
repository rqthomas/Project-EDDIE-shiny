EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and simulation modeling through the lens of limnology.
eco_forecast,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems and ecosystem components in response to an environmental driver such as climate variability, extreme weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area."
LO1,Describe an ecological forecast and the forecasting cycle
LO2,Explain how forecasting can be used to advance both our understanding of ecological processes  and natural resource management
LO3,Explore and visualize NEON data using an R Shiny interface
LO4,Use a simple box model to generate forecasts of ecosystem primary productivity with uncertainty
LO5,Adjust model parameters and inputs to study how they affect forecast performance relative to observations
LO6,Compare productivity responses to forecasts among NEON sites in different ecoclimatic regions
weather_forecast1,A weather forecast is probably the most widely used and applied forecast. Here we will examine the output from a weather forecast model from NOAA.
weather_forecast2,"Weather forecasts use multiple simulations from the same model, but alter the initial conditions of the model to generate different potential futures. A forecast is a combination of the future condtions and the uncertainty associated with it."
model1,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly."
model2,Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as 'Warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature' or 'a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer'
model3,"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems."
mod_desc,The model we will be using in this module is the nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model. The nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) model is a common tool in limnological and oceanographic research. The NPZ model represents the simplest sets of processes that usefully describe plankton dynamics.
ens_mod1,Ensemble modelling is using multiple simulations to predict an outcome and to reduce the generalization error of the prediction.
uncert1,"Uncertainty comes from natural variation and imperfect knowledge. Replicate samples is a methodology to capture uncertainty in measurements whereas imperfect knowledge is reflected in our models, such as the NPZ model. This model, like many other ecological models, makes assumptions. One such assumption is that zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton occurs at a constant rate. It is known that many different species of zooplankton feed at different rates but to reduce model complexity one rate is assumed for the entire group."
driver_uncert,"Driver uncertainty comes from uncertainty related to the variables used to drive the model. The key driver variables of our NPZ model are water temperature, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and nutrient loading. We do not know what these variables will be in the future but we can use weather forecast data to predict what they will be and then use that to drive the model."
param_uncert,"Parameter uncertainty refers to the uncertainty in the model parameter values, which can be due to uncertainties in the data or the calibration process used."
init_uncert,Initial conditions uncertainty refers to uncertainty arising because the initial conditions are not precisely known or because the calculations cannot be performed with the precise initial conditions.
