"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules.",Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and simulation modeling through the lens of limnology.,"An ecological forecast predicts changes in ecosystems and ecosystem components in response to an environmental driver such as climate variability, extreme weather conditions, pollution, or habitat change. It also provides information about how people, economies, and communities may be affected. Local authorities and members of the public use these early warnings to make decisions to protect the health and well-being of a particular area.",Understand key concepts with Ecological Forecasting,Define and use forecasting terminology,"Explain why ecological forecasting is important, useful and appropriate",Explore and visualize NEON data using R scripts or via a Shiny app,Understand what a simple box model represents and visualize model output,"A model is a representation (physical, conceptual or mathematical) of a real phenomenon that is difficult to observe directly.",Models can be as simple as a verbal statement about a subject or two boxes connected by an arrow to represent some relationship such as 'Warmer air temperature causes warmer lake surface temperature' or 'a higher number of wolves leads to a lower population of deer',"Alternatively, models can be extremely complex and detailed, such as a mathematical description of the pathways of nitrogen transformations within ecosystems.",The model we will be using in this module is a simple box model. This is a model that
