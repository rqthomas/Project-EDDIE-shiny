"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules.","Climate change is modifying the thermal structure of lakes around the globe.  In this module, students will learn how to use a lake model to explore the effects of altered weather on lakes, and then develop their own climate scenarios to test hypotheses about how lakes may change in the future.  Once the students have mastered running one climate scenario for their lake, they will learn how to use distributed computing software to scale up and run hundreds of different climate scenarios for their lakes.  The overarching goal of this module is for students to explore new modeling and computing tools while learning fundamental concepts about how climate change will affect lakes.","The GRAPLEr is an R package that allows you to set up hundreds of GLM simulations with varying input meteorological data and run those simulations
 efficiently and quickly using distributed computing. The model 'jobs' are submitted via a web service to run	on computers elsewhere, allowing you to
 rapidly set up and run hundreds of simulations, access the output, and analyze the data.","Have students install R and RStudio software on their laptops before class (send them the ""R You Ready for EDDIE"" file, below, for step-by-step directions).","Give students their handout ahead of time to read over prior to class, or distribute handouts when they arrive to class.","Instructor gives brief PowerPoint presentation on climate change effects on the thermal structure of lakes, an overview of the GLM model, and the GRAPLEr software.","After the presentation, the students divide into teams, set up the GLM files and R packages on their computer to run a default lake model and explore the output (Activity A).",The instructor then introduces Activity B.,"The students create hypotheses about how aspects of climate change may affect lakes (e.g., altered precipitation), develop a climate change scenario for their model lake to test their hypotheses, force a model lake with their scenario, and analyze the output to determine how their scenario alters lake thermal structure (Activity B).","After the students have analyzed the model output, they create some figures with their partners to present their model simulation and output to the rest of the class.",The instructor then moderates a discussion of the scenarios and output presented in Activity B and introduces Activity C.,"The students go through a demonstration of the GRAPLEr R package and then design and carry out their own simulation 'experiment' with their partners. If time permits, the students create additional figures from their experiment results and share them with the class, with the instructor moderating the discussion (Activity C).","The General Lake Model (GLM) is an open-access model for simulating lake dynamics. It simulates vertical stratification and mixing and accounts for the effect of inflows/outflows, surface heating and cooling. GLM has been designed to be an open-source community model developed in collaboration with members of the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to integrate with lake sensor data. ","This plots the meterological input data for the simulation- short wave & long wave radiation, air temp, etc. for the duration of the simulation run. Look at the figure in the ""Plots"" window in the bottom right corner of RStudio. This figure can be explored by clicking and highlighting areas of the plor for further inspection.","This plots your simulated water temperatures in a heat map, where time is displayed on the x-axis, lake depth is displayed on the y-axis, and the different colors represent different temperatures. You can interact with the graph by selecting an area and zooming to that area.","To save your plot you can click on the camera icon in the op right above the plot ""Download plot as a png""."
